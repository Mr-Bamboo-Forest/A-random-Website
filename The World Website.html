		<h3 id="ALSATW"> A little song about the world. </h3>
		<p id="song-about-world">O friends, no more these sounds!<br>
		Let us sing more cheerful songs,<br>
		more full of joy!<br>
		 <br>
		Joy, bright spark of divinity,<br>
		Daughter of Elysium,<br>
		Fire-inspired we tread<br>
		Thy sanctuary.<br>
		 <br>
		Thy magic power re-unites<br>
		All that custom has divided,<br>
		All men become brothers<br>
		Under the sway of thy gentle wings.<br>
		 <br>
		Whoever has created<br>
		An abiding friendship,<br>
		Or has won<br>
		A true and loving wife,<br>
		All who can call at least one soul theirs,<br>
		Join in our song of praise;<br>
		But any who cannot must creep tearfully<br>
		Away from our circle.<br>
		 <br>
		All creatures drink of joy<br>
		At nature's breast.<br>
		Just and unjust<br>
		Alike taste of her gift;<br>
		 <br>
		She gave us kisses and the fruit of the vine,<br>
		A tried friend to the end.<br>
		Even the worm can feel contentment,<br>
		And the cherub stands before God!<br>
		 <br>
		Gladly, like the heavenly bodies<br>
		Which He set on their courses<br>
		Through the splendor of the firmament;<br>
		Thus, brothers, you should run your race,<br>
		As a hero going to conquest.<br>
		 <br>
		You millions, I embrace you.<br>
		This kiss is for all the world!<br>
		 <br>
		Brothers, above the starry canopy<br>
		There must dwell a loving Father.<br>
		 <br>
		Do you fall in worship, you millions?<br>
		World, do you know your creator?<br>
		 <br>
		Seek him in the heavens;<br>
		Above the stars must He dwell.<br>
